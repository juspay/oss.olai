  Periodically re-run the three-agent debate that hunts for missing
  "electricity receptacles" — volatility worth encapsulating behind a stable
  socket — across olai's packages, modules, and kolu upstream. Triggers on

# Lowy electricity — the receptacle debate

Run an [llm-debate](https://github.com/srid/llm-debate/blob/master/.apm/skills/debate/SKILL.md) among three agents (this one plus two others, e.g. opencode and Grok), each assigned one altitude — **package**, **module**, **upstream-into-kolu** — all arguing *for* volatility-based extraction per Juval Löwy's electricity-receptacle analogy ([Righting Software ch. 2](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2995357&seqNum=2), read in full by every debater; the [lowy skill](https://github.com/srid/agency/blob/master/.apm/skills/lowy/SKILL.md) is the bar). Every candidate must pass the article's four tests explicitly — the opaque socket, functional-but-not-domain-functional, the oscilloscope, the vault. Debate turns live in a `debates/lowy-electricity-<date>/` working folder at this vault's root — untracked working material, never committed to the olai repository; after the debate ends, file the conclusion only (the folder's README.md) as `olai/lowy-electricity/debate-<date>.md` — never a bare `<date>.md` basename, which daily-notes detection would claim as a day's note — and the human ratifies before anything is filed or dispatched.
